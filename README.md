# Rails to TypeSpec

This package demonstrates a miniature Rails schema to TypeSpec generator. It intentionally focuses on clarity over completeness so the CI failure described in the task can be reproduced locally and verified once fixed.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node --test
```
